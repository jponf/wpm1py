These problems are obtained by SAT transformation from 
JSSP(job shop scheduling problems) in OR-Library(
http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/info.html).
The transformation is based on Crawford and Baker's method
described in Proc. of AAAI-94. 
Each problem file is named xxx-yyy-zzz.
xxx is problem name, yyy is a lower bound of the optimal schedule, and
zzz is a upper bound of the optimal schedule.
A Max-SAT solution represents a optimal schedule whose length is
'yyy+uuu' where uuu is the number of soft clauses
satisfied in the solution.
