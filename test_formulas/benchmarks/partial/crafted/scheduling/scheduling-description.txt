Definitions:
1.       *Population* = admission year X admission semester X track. Admission year \in last 4 years, admission semester \in {winter, spring}, tack \in 4 possible tracks.
2.       *Unit* = 1,2 or 3 hours that are scheduled consecutively. For example, a 3-hours course can be split to two units of 1 + 2 hours.
3.       Unit *type* \in {lecture, recitation, lab})
 
Constraints:
1.       Teachers' constraints: impossible slots (hard), preferable slots (soft), undesirable slots (soft).
2.       TA's constraints: same as teachers constraints + courses they intend to take as students.
3.       Population constraints. Each population has a set of courses they have to take in each of the 8 semesters of their studies.  The courses in each such set cannot overlap (hard). Elective courses suggested for that population should not overlap themselves (soft) or the mandatory courses (soft).
4.       Unfavorable hours for scheduling, like after 6 pm, etc. (soft).
5.       Teachers constraints due to multiple teaching: courses taught by the same teacher (or a TA) cannot overlap (hard).
6.       Splitting constraints: each course of 3 hours or more should/should not be split to units (e.g. 2 + 1 for a 3 hour course)  according to a given weight (soft).
7.       Units of the same course should not overlap.
8.       Multiple groups of the same course/type should overlap (soft).
9.       There should not be 'holes' in the schedule (soft. Proportional to the number of holes).
10.   Certain flagged courses should be scheduled later in the day because they target external students (soft).
 
 
There is a  variable for each course/type/unit/day, indicating whether that course/type/unit was scheduled that day, and
      for each course/type/unit/hour, indicating whether that course/type/unit was scheduled earlier than that hour.
 
 
Numbers: slots: 60, ~ 100 courses, ~200 teachers + TAs, 4 tracks.
