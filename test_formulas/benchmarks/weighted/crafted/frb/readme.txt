The weighted Max-2-SAT benchmarks submitted are transformed from forced satisfiable SAT benchmarks of Model RB. These benchmarks are planted with hidden optimum solutions. For more information, please see http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/benchmarks/max-sat-benchmarks.htm
The same kind of benchmarks were submitted last year with smaller size (frb10, frb15 and frb20).
