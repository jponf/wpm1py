Benchmark Description
for Max-SAT Evaluation 2008
===========================

All problems in the MPE suite are MPE queries on randomly generated Bayesian networks.

1) A Bayesian network is generated with a specified connectivity.
2) All leaf nodes are randomly asserted as evidence.
3) The resulting MPE query is converted into a weighted Max-SAT problem. (see "Using Weighted MAX-SAT Engines to Solve MPE" by Park, 2002)
4) The real weights are adjusted to fit the range in the format.
